Abstract

We present a novel theoretical and numerical framework, the Gearwork Universe (GU) theory, in which gravity, redshift, and quantum uncertainty emerge from entropy-phase stratifications across a block universe. In this model, the universe is composed of interlocking entropy-defined regions—“gears”—whose angular relationships influence observed phenomena. We demonstrate that redshift correlates with entropy gradients rather than recessional velocity, that quantum uncertainty results from phase misalignment between these gears, and that gravity emerges as a curvature effect from entropy field gradients. Our numerical simulations visualize gear-phase misalignment and entropic curvature and are qualitatively consistent with cosmological and quantum measurements. The GU theory provides an alternative to models invoking dark energy or gravitons and opens new pathways for empirical investigation.

1. Introduction

Modern physics faces unresolved challenges in unifying gravity with quantum mechanics and explaining phenomena such as dark energy, wavefunction collapse, and time asymmetry. The Gearwork Universe (GU) theory proposes a unified framework based on entropy geometry, avoiding reliance on particle-based mediation or spacetime expansion.

In GU, the universe comprises interlocking regions—entropy gears—defined by directional entropy gradients. The alignment and misalignment of these gradients manifest as relativistic and quantum effects. We build a numerical foundation for GU and compare its implications to existing astrophysical and quantum data.

2. Theoretical Framework

2.1 Entropy Gears and Observer-Relative Geometry

An entropy gear is defined as a region of spacetime characterized by a directional entropy gradient vector field. Misalignment between gears gives rise to apparent time flow and quantum behavior.

2.2 Redshift from Entropy Gradient

z = \frac{S_B - S_A}{S_A}
Where S_A is the entropy at photon emission, and S_B is entropy at detection. This replaces Doppler-like expansion explanations with entropy differential across time-like surfaces.

2.3 Gear-Phase Misalignment and Quantum Decoherence

\Delta \theta_{ij} = \arccos\left( \frac{\nabla S_i \cdot \nabla S_j}{|\nabla S_i||\nabla S_j|} \right)
High \Delta \theta regions yield high quantum uncertainty.

2.4 Gravity as Entropic Curvature

R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2} g_{\mu\nu} R = \frac{1}{\kappa} \left( \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu S - g_{\mu\nu} S \right)
Gravity emerges as a macroscopic entropic effect.

4. Observational Correlations
	•	Redshift without expansion
	•	Entanglement via retrocausality
	•	Galaxy rotation without dark matter
	•	Graviton non-detection is predicted

6. Discussion

GU reframes fundamental interactions as emergent entropic effects. While theoretical, it offers explanations for major cosmological and quantum features without new particles or forces.

7. Conclusion

Entropy-phase geometry may offer a unifying model for space, time, gravity, and quantum uncertainty. The GU theory encourages a reinterpretation of cosmological measurements through the lens of thermodynamics.
